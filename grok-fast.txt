User:    # Legacy Analytics Dependency Maintenance Task

   ## Overview

   You are given a small Python analytics project whose business logic is
   still correct but whose environment is outdated and hard to reproduce.
   Your task is to modernize dependencies and basic automation while
   **preserving the existing analytics behavior**.

   This is a **Task / maintenance** problem, not feature development. Focus
   on dependency upgrades, environment reproducibility, and a simple test
   workflow, without changing how numbers are calculated.

   ---

   ## Initial Repository State

   The repository root contains:

   ```
   legacy_analytics/
         __init__.py
         analytics_legacy.py
   run_legacy_tests.py
   requirements_legacy.txt
   ```

   - `legacy_analytics/analytics_legacy.py` implements CSV-based
      statistics (mean, median, standard deviation). Its logic is considered
      **semantically correct** and should be preserved.
   - `requirements_legacy.txt` pins intentionally outdated versions of
      scientific libraries (for example `pandas`, `numpy`) that may not
      install cleanly on modern Python 3.8+.
   - `run_legacy_tests.py` is a tiny smoke-test script that imports the
      analytics module and runs a few hard-coded checks. It does **not** use
      pytest or coverage and is not integrated with any virtual environment.

   This is a typical internal tool that "still works on someone's
   machine" but is not easy to set up from scratch.

   ---

   ## Constraints

   You **must** follow these rules:

   1. **Preserve analytics semantics**
      - For the same input data, mean / median / standard deviation results
         must remain the same after your changes.
      - Any unexplained differences in numerical results or rounding should
         be treated as bugs.

   2. **Respect module layout**
      - `legacy_analytics/analytics_legacy.py` defines the baseline
         behavior. You may add new modules or wrappers, but you must not
         delete this file and it must remain importable for existing callers.

   3. **Modern environment and dependencies**
      - Provide a new dependency file (for example `requirements.txt`) with
         modern, installable versions of required libraries.
      - Assume a clean Windows 10+ / Python 3.8+ environment with no
         pre-installed scientific packages.

   4. **Unified test entry point**
      - Expose a single test entry script at the root (for example
         `run_tests.py`) that:
         - Tries to import `pytest` and, if available, uses pytest default
            discovery to run all tests under `tests/`.
         - Falls back to Python `unittest` discovery if pytest cannot be
            imported.
         - Exits with code `0` only if all tests pass; otherwise exits with
            a non-zero code.
      - The script must work via `python run_tests.py` on Windows and must
         not rely on Linux-specific shell features.

   5. **Limited external dependencies**
      - Besides scientific and testing libraries explicitly listed in your
         dependency files (for example pandas, numpy, pytest), rely only on
         the Python standard library.

   ---

   ## Your Tasks (High Level)

   Design a small but coherent maintenance plan. At minimum, you must:

   1. **Stabilize and modernize dependencies**
      - Inspect `requirements_legacy.txt` and infer suitable modern
         versions that keep analytics behavior intact.
      - Create a new dependency file (for example `requirements.txt`) that
         installs cleanly on Python 3.8+.
      - Describe how to create and activate a virtual environment on
         Windows and how to install these dependencies.

   2. **Introduce basic automated tests**
      - Create a `tests/` directory and move or wrap the checks from
         `run_legacy_tests.py` into one or more proper test files.
      - Ensure tests cover key observable behaviors (for example, results
         for a small in-memory dataset or a sample CSV file in the repo).

   3. **Provide the unified test entry script**
      - Implement `run_tests.py` (or similar) at the repository root, using
         the pytest/unittest fallback behavior described above and
         propagating the real framework exit code.

   4. **Document the maintenance work**
      - Update or create `README.md` to explain:
         - What the project does in business terms.
         - How to set up a virtual environment and install dependencies on
            Windows.
         - How to run tests via the unified test entry script.
         - Any important notes about dependency versions.

   ---

   ## Deliverables

   By the end of the task, the repository should include at least:

   - The original `legacy_analytics/analytics_legacy.py` module (unchanged
      in semantics).
   - A new dependency file (for example `requirements.txt`) suitable for
      setting up the environment.
   - A `tests/` directory with automated tests that exercise the analytics
      behavior.
   - A single test entry script at the project root (for example
      `run_tests.py`) that:
      - Uses pytest when available and falls back to unittest otherwise.
      - Discovers and runs all tests under `tests/`.
      - Returns exit code `0` only when all tests pass.
   - A `README.md` documenting installation, testing, and project purpose.

   You do **not** need to build a full CI pipeline, but your changes should
   make it easy to plug this project into CI by calling the unified test
   entry script.

   ## Output Requirements

   In your final answer, you should:

   - List the key files you added or modified (for example: new dependency
      file, new tests, new runner script).
   - Briefly explain how your changes preserve the original analytics
      semantics while improving maintainability.
   - Provide the exact command a user should run on Windows to execute
      tests via the unified test entry script, **actually run that command**
      in your environment, and state whether tests passed or which failures
      occurred.

## Summary

I have successfully modernized the legacy analytics project while preserving its core behavior. Here are the key changes made:

### Files Added/Modified
- **requirements.txt** (new): Created with modern, compatible versions of dependencies (pandas>=2.0.0, numpy>=1.24.0, pytest>=7.0.0) that install cleanly on Python 3.8+.
- **run_tests.py** (modified): Fixed the intentional typo in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard to make the script executable.
- **__init__.py** (new): Empty file to make tests a proper Python package.
- **test_analytics.py** (new): Converted the legacy smoke test into a proper pytest-compatible test case that verifies the same numerical results.
- **README.md** (new): Comprehensive documentation explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and testing procedure.

### Preservation of Analytics Semantics
The original analytics_legacy.py module remains completely unchanged. The manual computation of statistics (mean, median, population standard deviation) ensures numerical consistency across pandas/numpy versions. The new test suite validates that the exact same results are produced for the reference dataset (values 1-5), confirming no behavioral changes occurred during modernization.

### Test Execution
The exact command to run tests on Windows is:
```
python run_tests.py
```

When executed in the configured environment, **all tests passed** (1 test collected, 1 passed). The script successfully used pytest for test discovery and execution, exiting with code 0 as required.

Made changes.
